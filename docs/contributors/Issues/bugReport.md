# How to submit a bug report:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** — check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** — try to reproduce it using the latest [release](https://github.com/xhemals/event-countdown-banner/releases).

3. **Isolate the problem** — ideally create a reduced test case. If you're reporting a bug related to a specific WordPress setup or theme, please provide details about it.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What WordPress version, theme, and plugins are you using? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Please use the template provided.

When you are ready, [Submit your bug here](https://github.com/xhemals/event-countdown-banner/issues/new/choose)
