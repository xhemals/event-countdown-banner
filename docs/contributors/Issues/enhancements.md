# How to submit an enhancement suggestion

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** — check if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

2. **Check the roadmap** — look at the project roadmap or open projects (if any) to see if the enhancement is already planned for the future.

3. **Specify the enhancement's details** — when you're opening an issue to suggest an enhancement, include as many details as possible. Fill in the template, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

4. **Use a clear and descriptive title** — for the issue to identify the suggestion.

5. **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.

6. **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.

7. **Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why**.

8. **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Event Countdown Header which the suggestion is related to. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux.

9. **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Event Countdown Header users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a community plugin.

10. **List some other plugins where this enhancement exists**, if applicable.
