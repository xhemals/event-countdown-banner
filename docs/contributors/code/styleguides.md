# Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

-   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
-   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
-   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
-   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Styleguide for languages

Please use prettier and the `.prettierrc` config file if you have [prettier](https://prettier.io) installed.

If you do not use prettier, please run `npm run buildGit` before submitting a pull request. This will format all the files with the correct formatting.
